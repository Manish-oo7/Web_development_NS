      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics"><h3>Calisthenics</h3></a>
      <p>Natural body building with body weight.</p>
      <p>Calisthenics is a form of exercise consisting of a variety of movements which exercise large muscle groups (gross motor movements),
        such as running, standing, grasping, pushing, etc. These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, 
        as bodyweight exercises. They are intended to increase strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing,
        bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's bodyweight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic 
        conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination.</p>
      <p>We provide you proper guidence and training for body building through Calisthenics. Our coaches are one 
          of the best in body building industry and IFBB certified. </p>

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics"><h3>Aeshthetics</h3></a>
      <p>Aesthatic body building.</p>
      <p>Normal bodybuilding is mostly concerned about increasing strength for you to lift more weights and be a stronger version of yourself.
        Aesthetics are actually secondary and not a gauge of your ability. Aesthetic bodybuilding, of course, is concerned primarily about how
        good your body looks with muscles. How much you can lift and your strength is secondary. Modeling aspirations play a big part in the
        Aesthetic bodybuilder as some of them may take this sport up just to look good enough and become a model. Indeed, having big muscles is
        a great way to start up a modeling career.</p>
        <p>We provide you proper guidence and training for body building through Aesthatics. Our coaches are one 
            of the best in body building industry and IFBB certified. </p>

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoga"><h3>Yoga</h3></a>
      <p>Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices or disciplines which originated in ancient India.</p>
      <p>There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. The term "Yoga" in the Western
        world often denotes a modern form of hatha yoga and yoga as exercise, consisting largely of the postures called asanas.
        The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-vedic Indian traditions; possibly in the Indus valley civilization around 
        3000 BCE. Yoga is mentioned in the Rigveda, also referenced in the Upanishads, but yoga most likely developed as a systematic study 
        around the 5th and 6th centuries BCE, in ancient India's ascetic and śramaṇa movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing
        yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to Upanishads. Hatha yoga texts emerged sometimes between the 9th and 11th century with
        origins in tantra.</p>

      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerobics"><h3>Aerobic</h3></a>        
      <p>Aerobic activities make you breathe harder and make your heart and blood vessels healthier. These include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Walking</li>
          <li>Dancing </li>
          <li>Swimming</li>
          <li>Water aerobics</li>
          <li>Jogging and running</li>
          <li>Aerobic classes</li>
          <li>Bicycle riding</li>
          <li>Gardening Activities</li>
          <li>Golfing</li>
      </ul>
      <p> Formal aerobics classes are divided into different levels of intensity and complexity and will have five components: warm-up (5–10 minutes), 
          cardiovascular conditioning (25–30 minutes), muscular strength and conditioning (10–15 minutes), cool-down (5–8 minutes) and 
          stretching and flexibility (5–8 minutes). Aerobics classes may allow participants to select their level of participation 
          according to their fitness level.</p>
